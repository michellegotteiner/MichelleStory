Billy the bear hibernated all winter and then woke up and it was spring. Billy went to the river to go fishing because he was hungry. He caught three salmon and ate them for dinner. 
What he didn't know was that the salmon were part of a larger salmon empire, consisting of millions of salmon warriors. Little did he know that he started one of the largest wars
of all time, the Great Salmon and Bear war. Millions of bears and salmons were recruited to join the fight, and what ensued was mass chaos.
