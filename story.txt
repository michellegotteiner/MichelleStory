Billy the bear hibernated all winter and then woke up and it was spring. Billy went to the river to go fishing because he was hungry. He caught three salmon and ate them for dinner. 
What he didn't know was that the salmon were part of a larger salmon empire, consisting of millions of salmon warriors. Little did he know that he started one of the largest wars
of all time, the Great Salmon and Bear war. Millions of bears and salmons were recruited to join the fight, and what ensued was mass chaos.

Rivers were destroyed, many parts of the forest had burn to the ground. Fish and bears laid dead across the land. 
Many bears had lost their homes to the salmon empire, and many salmon families were taken as prisoners of war.
Some bears even had to migrate towards the north, converting themselves into polar bears.

The bears that convereted into polar bears had to now fight the seals in the north. It seemed as though there was no end to the war. As soon as the salmon in the south found out about the situation between seals and bears, they joined forces with the seals in their fight against the bears. Together the seals and the salmon formed the greatest force the world has ever seen. They started pushing the polar bears towards extinction.
